Task from my course WordPress for Developers at <a href="https://softuni.bg/">SoftUni</a>

<b> Course Curriculum: WordPress for Developers </b>

**Introduction to WordPress and Web Servers**: <br>
In my introduction to WordPress and web servers, I learned that WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) used for building websites and blogs, known for its ease of use and extensive plugin and theme support. I also explored the basics of web servers, which are responsible for delivering web content to users over the internet. Domains represent the address or name of a website, while virtual hosts allow a single web server to host multiple domains or websites efficiently. This knowledge provided me with a foundational understanding of how websites are created and managed online.

**[PHP Introduction](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/WordPress-for-Developers/tree/main/PHP-Introduction/lesson)**: <br>
During this lesson, I covered PHP fundamentals, including understanding what PHP is and how it integrates within web development. I practiced working with essential elements such as variables, arrays, loops, and functions, and I learned basic string manipulation techniques. This lesson equipped me with a foundational understanding of PHP's core concepts and how they are applied in backend development to build dynamic web pages.

**WordPress Hooks, Actions and Tools**: <br>
I learned about WordPress hooks, actions, and tools to understand the core functions that keep WordPress running smoothly. I explored The Loop, which controls how posts are displayed, and worked with WP-CLI and Query Monitor to manage and troubleshoot WordPress sites more efficiently. I also practiced using debug logs and basic debugging techniques to quickly identify and fix errors, making development in WordPress easier and more effective.
