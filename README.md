**<ins>Introduction to WordPress and Web Servers</ins>**: <br>
In my introduction to WordPress and web servers, I learned that WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) used for building websites and blogs, known for its ease of use and extensive plugin and theme support. I also explored the basics of web servers, which are responsible for delivering web content to users over the internet. Domains represent the address or name of a website, while virtual hosts allow a single web server to host multiple domains or websites efficiently. This knowledge provided me with a foundational understanding of how websites are created and managed online.

**[PHP Introduction](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/WordPress-for-Developers/tree/main/PHP-Introduction/lesson)**: <br>
During this lesson, I covered PHP fundamentals, including understanding what PHP is and how it integrates within web development. I practiced working with essential elements such as variables, arrays, loops, and functions, and I learned basic string manipulation techniques. This lesson equipped me with a foundational understanding of PHP's core concepts and how they are applied in backend development to build dynamic web pages.

**<ins>WordPress Hooks, Actions and Tools</ins>**: <br>
I learned about WordPress hooks, actions, and tools to understand the core functions that keep WordPress running smoothly. I explored The Loop, which controls how posts are displayed, and worked with WP-CLI and Query Monitor to manage and troubleshoot WordPress sites more efficiently. I also practiced using debug logs and basic debugging techniques to quickly identify and fix errors, making development in WordPress easier and more effective.

**<ins>Theme Development Introduction</ins>**: <br>
In the lecture on WordPress theme development, I was introduced to the structure and organization of WordPress themes, including file naming conventions and template usage. I also learned about creating and working with child themes to safely extend and modify existing themes without changing the original codebase.

**<ins>Plugin Development Introduction</ins>**: <br>
In this lesson, I learned to use tools like Webpack, Gulp, and Sass to optimize plugin development and improve theme structure. I also explored integrating with Gutenberg and block themes to enhance customization and functionality. This knowledge equipped me to create more robust WordPress plugins and themes with a cleaner structure and advanced features.

**<ins>Theme Development Tools and Improvement</ins>** : <br>
I extended my theme by exploring key WordPress components such as menus, sidebars, and widgets. I also touched on the concept of task managers, mentioned block themes, and learned a few new useful functions to enhance theme functionality. This deepened my understanding of theme customization and development.

**<ins>Plugin Extension and Enhancement</ins>** : <br>
I extended plugins and enhanced their functionality to make them more versatile and effective. I learned how to add new features and improve existing ones, ensuring they better meet user needs. This experience helped me refine my skills in customizing and building upon existing plugin features.

**<ins>Project Enhancement and Server Deployment</ins>** : <br>
 I covered how to enhance a WordPress project by optimizing features and preparing it for live environments. I demonstrated the process of deploying a WordPress site to a server, ensuring all configurations were correct for a successful launch. The lesson aimed to help developers take their projects from local development to a live production server smoothly.

**<ins>Course Project</ins>** : <br>
For the regular exam of this course, there was a project assignment, here is a link to the repository: [Wordpress Lifestyle Blog](https://github.com/trayanaboykova/WordPress-Lifestyle-Blog)
