<b> Course Curriculum: WordPress for Developers </b>

**Introduction to WordPress and Web Servers**: <br>
In my introduction to WordPress and web servers, I learned that WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) used for building websites and blogs, known for its ease of use and extensive plugin and theme support. I also explored the basics of web servers, which are responsible for delivering web content to users over the internet. Domains represent the address or name of a website, while virtual hosts allow a single web server to host multiple domains or websites efficiently. This knowledge provided me with a foundational understanding of how websites are created and managed online.
